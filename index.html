	<h1>The Pillow</h1>
    <p>The pillow, propped on top of my bed, is milk-white with all the depth of gnocchi. It is a soft support bag stuffed with an aerated block of memory foam that is meant to keep my spine in a neutral position, aligning my neck with the rest of my body, which supports good posture. The tag attached to it mentions how it’s meant to cushion my head during sleep. When pressing my hands down, applying pressure, It’s fluffy while still feeling kind of gelatinous. Thankfully, unlike gelatine, the tag doesn’t mention anything about the pillow’s expiration date.</p>
